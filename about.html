            <h3>ABOUT US:</h3>
            <p>
                The Flavors of Modern the World was created in 2018 out of a passion for the

                amazing food and service. The Flavors of the World was very known by its

                unique menu that the foods that we offer are based in the different
                countries. We came up with the concept of using the flavors of the world

                because we want our customers to expecience different flavors from the other

                countries.
